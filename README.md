 What an appropriate name for a nice new calendaring system based on [28-day "Lunar" Months](^6)

We've been working on a calendar of holidays for a long time, when it occured to us that our months are intrinsically stupid. Like, why are there 4 months with 30 days, 7 months of 31 days, and then February (which no-one can spell appropriately) with it's 28 or 29 days? What absurdity is this?

And then we found out about [Eastman (of Kodak)'s 13 month/28 day calendar](/#1). It's brilliant!

[^6]The lunar month is technically 29.5 days long, and so the moon will rise and set all over the place. It seems like this should move Easter around, making the Catholics happy, but probably will do nothing for the Jews. Which is techinically fine, since this is a religion with which they are likely unfamiliar, except their most learned scholars.
