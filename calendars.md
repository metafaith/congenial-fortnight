Making a list of the various religious calendars, so that we can add the various religious holidays of major world religions to our calendar.
The intent is to create, programatically, a consolidated calendar on our 13/28 calendar, output in .ics format so that it is consumable by 
various calendaring systems globally, not the least of which is the calendar widget on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/metafaith).

We are hardly the first people on this planet to deign to create a calendaring system. Really, since we don't know quite *where* we are in the multiverse of universes,
we can hardly know *when* we are. This said, we, as humans, tend to use the Sun and the Moon to mark time, which makes a lot of sense here on Earth. Unsure of how or 
when, if ever, we would or even *could* leave this planet, it makes sense that for Human Time, we mark time by Luna and Sol.

So then, this page is a nice reference of research for the different calendars of the world, in an attempt to reconcile some knowledge about the same. Personally, I think
we should move towards the Eastman-Kodak 28-day/13-month calendar. Not only do I think we should move towards it, I think it's summarily the best calendar available
and I think that it coincides very nicely with both Tarot and ♠️♣️♦️♥️ Card decks, which is an important part of human history and divinity.

## New Years Day

The only day that we pause, around the world, and celebrate. It's a day of rest, globally, it would seem. Most countries have adopted it, along with some version of
the Gregorian calendar, due mostly to desire to sync with the United States, mostly with an eye for commerce with the same. The US was seen globally as one of the
richest countries in the world, though whether it was or not was up to a lot of debate. We can put on our history hats and have a look back and see that perhaps it was
not always so "universally" accepted. The US Dollar, however, is still revered around the world, and most countries will happily accept it in commerce in place of their
local currency, and this has led to a sort of hubris about this fact from many Americans. The tie between commerce and the calendar, however, is not a mistake.
George Eastman recognized this in his attempts to popularize the [International Fixed Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar) as he felt
it made it much easier to do sales comparison data, and taxes, though [due probably to his suicide in 1932 it was not more universally adopted](https://theinternetsaysitstrue.com/2022/03/28/13-months-the-kodak-calendar-experiment/).

The New Year is in fact celebrated at different times around the world. In China, which traditionally follows the Lunar Calendar, they celebrate the end of their 13th 
month approximately in February of of the Gregorian calendar. In the Ethiopian calendar, it's a whole 5-6 day period, which is considered a short month for them, 
and it arrives in Gregorian August 29/30. These are all interesting considerations. **Should our calendar start in a strange time just after the dawn of Winter?**

### National Institute of Standards and Technology

This is the United States national body of technological standards, of which, time is an important role. They are not known for their various calendars, however, they 
are known for atomic accuracy of the time, for whatever that means. There was once a really great question posed by V-Sauce, what time *is* it? Well, it would depend
entirely on *where* we are...

From their site:
> The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.

### [Time and Date](https://www.timeanddate.com/)

This is one of the oldest calendar references on the internet, starting in 1995. They tie in with the [US National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://nist.gov)
and have been providing accurate time and date services for a very long [time](https://www.nist.time.gov/).  
They offer a wide array of calendaring resources, most of which are centered around astronomical or otherwise scientific events, though they do subscribe wholly to the
very flawed Gregorian calendar, which we are essentially aiming to correct...with Science, ironically.  

That said, they do at least offer different calendars and a seemingly deep reference for each of them. For example, the [Buddhist Calendar](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/buddhist-calendar.html)
enjoys a great reference from them and is quite technically accurate.

They have an [API](https://www.timeanddate.com/services/api/) which may prove useful, though it's free only for 3 months, so we would have to start taking collection
to maintain access to it. The [Time And Date Developers site](https://dev.timeanddate.com) is https://dev.timeanddate.com

### [Calendar Labs](https://www.calendarlabs.com/)

This site contains a variety of printable calendars and a wealth of information about the different calendars of the world. Much of it is the same sort of information that
may be found on more well-designed sites, such as [https://www.theworldcalendar.org](https://www.theworldcalendar.org), though I'm still unsure if that site was not 
written by GPTBot.

Of most interest for development would likely be their [ICS Calendars page](https://www.calendarlabs.com/ical-calendar/) which could prove useful for scraping and pulling together
the different dates. They seem to offer most calendars in ICS, XLS, and PDF formats, so anything a person could want.

### [The World Calendar .org](https://www.theworldcalendar.org)

This is a super interesting site if you're ready to get nerdy with your calendars and religions. They propose "Calendar calculus in different religions of the world"
It seems that you can URL hack their dates by adding a slash-separated date in YYYY/MM/DD format to the end of the URL. So, `2022/12/02` can be referenced
at [`https://www.theworldcalendar.org/2022/12/02/`](https://www.theworldcalendar.org/2022/12/02/) ... Well, it would seem that way, but instead, it seems that this
will lead you to a [404 page](https://http.cat/404). If you dig too far into the site, eventually you will come up on a page explaining [how the World Calendar Works]
(https://www.theworldcalendar.org/how-does-the-world-calendar-work/) that I can only surmise was written by either the authors of the bible, or a bot, or possibly both
simultaneously, given how many contradictions there are.  Nonetheless, this site remains a valuable tool, or at least a point of interest.

## Arguments For and Against Calendar Reform

According to calendartruth.info, "The Essenes, Egyptians, Polynesians, Maya, Inca, Lakota, and Cherokee used a 13-month, 28-day calendar. The Celtic knowledge of the Druids is based on the Tree Calendar, also a 13-month, 28-day calendar."
If true, this would effectively make the 13/28 calendar one of the oldest calendars in existence, perhaps the oldest, and this coincides nicely with the fact that what we are today calling the Meta Faith is factually the oldest "religion" in existence.  
However, it would seem from some basic research that the Essenes did not use a 28 day/month calendar. So that does seem false. 
Also false is that the Egyptians used a 28 day calendar--they did not. As noted, the Egyptians used a 120/4 day calendar, which makes sense, as the lunar cycle is 29.5 days, roughly, and the monsoon season would be roughly 3 months in Ethiopia


Of course, the falsification of one part does not mean that all parts are false. This bears more research...

### Proponents of Calendar Reform

- [CalendarTruth.info](https://web.archive.org/web/20220813092626/https://calendartruth.info/calendar-history/) It's truly curious that this site is considered bad by Malwarebytes Web Guard. I suspect that either they were taken over by bots or otherwise compromised a long time ago.

# Global and Historic Considerations

It becomes worthwhile to consider what calendars have existed throughout humanity, at least those that we can find evidence about. Considering the strong ties between
systems of currency, systems of time keeping, and systems of belief, and the use of each as measures of control of Humans throughout our histories, it would be short-sighted
to not consider if our month-based calendar is even correct or proper at all.

It would seem that this calendar is quite a complicated one, but which does add up to 365 days, ultimately. Most simply put, it goes something like this:  
Months of 30 days, every 3rd month gets 31 days. This makes up 364 days...  
Every seventh year gets an extra week...  
then it gets complicated.  
I can't quite make it out, but the math does add up, I think, I just *can't recite it now.*  
Frankly, I'm not positive that this doesn't represent retro-calculation to make it fit with our modern understanding.
Additionally, Dr. Tabor would be upset because he has quite a different interpretation, with a week lasting a full lunar cycle.  So basically a week was a month.
And this would make more sense with this interpretation that days and weeks are added every seventh year..
As well, it would make the time scale mentioned in the Old Testament make a lot more sense. Indeed, I would need to learn Aramaic to have any hope of deciphering what is correct versus what is retrofit. I do, so far, trust Dr. Tabor's translations, and I do think that he knows Aramaic.

- [How the ancient Egyptians switched from a lunar to a solar calendar [Questionable, but interesting]](https://mjaac.com/how-the-ancient-egyptians-switched-from-a-lunar-to-a-solar-calendar.html)

The Egyptian Calendar looks a lot like the Ethiopian Calendar, which is of little surprise. The Egyptian Calendar, by all accounts, is a 120 day 3 season calendar, divided into 4 months of 30 days, with an extra 5 day period every year.
This was their civil calendar, designed to reflect the difference between the Lunar calendar and the Solar calendar, but which could necessarily not map to either directly
They maintained a Lunar calendar for religious rites and rituals, but kept the Civil calendar for solar and scientific accuracy and for civil needs, such as taxation

#### The Calculus of the Civil Calendar

It seems that they had 3 seasons, the Inundation, The Go-Forth, and the Harvest. Each season was divided into 4 months of 30 days, which by some accounts, were themselves
divided by three decades of 10 days. (note that decade here is not 10 years, but 10 days) The only unit of time longer than a year in Ancient Egypt was named for the
King or Pharoah of the day, and so the date was read first by the year of the Pharoah, then by the Season, then by the Month, and then the Day.

#### Social & Religious Significance, Dual Calendars, and Nileometry

Egypt actually had two calendars, a Lunar calendar used for rituals and spiritual symbolism, and the Solar calendar, told by the rising of the Nile, which was caused by
the yearly monsoon season of the Ethiopian Plateau. The Nile was said to flood "like clockwork" which did give confusion in the modern era about the calendar significance
of the Nileometers, however, they were not actually time keeping devices. Instead, the prediction of the flooding of the Nile was done by the priests of the time, which
bore direct semblance into the revenue to be expected from crops, and therefore set the rates of taxation. I'm sure this must have been a point of contention among the farmers of the day,
and so it was linked to religious significance. The reading of the Nile was a well-studied thing which required significant knowledge, much of which must have been kept 
esoteric so as to preserve the religious sanctity of the readings, and to help dissuade peasant farmers from arguing against the priests determinations of tax.

### Mesoamerican / Mayan Calendars

- [History of Calendars - psy-minds.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20221225035252/https://psy-minds.com/history-of-calendars/)

###### This section copied directly from psy-minds.com and needs sourcing and revision

Of all the ancient calendar systems, the Maya and other Mesoamerican systems are the most complex. The Mayan calendar had 2 years, the 260-day Sacred Round, or tzolkin, and the 365-day Vague Year, or haab.

The Sacred Round of 260 days is composed of two smaller cycles: the numbers 1 through 13, coupled with 20 different day names: Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chicchan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Eiznab, Cauac, and Ahau.

The Sacred Round was used to determine important activities related to the gods and humans: name individuals, predict the future, decide on auspicious dates for battles, marriages, and so on.

The two cycles of 13 and 20 intermesh and are repeated without interruption: the cycle would begin with 1 Imix, then 2 Ik, then 3 Akbal and so on until the number 13 was reached, at which point the number cycle was restarted so 13 Ben would be followed by 1 Ix, 2 Men and so on. This time Imix would be numbered 8. The cycle ended after 260 days, with the last day being 13 Ahau.

The Vague Year of 365 days is similar to our modern calendar, consisting of 18 months of 20 days each, with an unlucky five-day period at the end.

The Vague Year had to do primarily with the seasons and agriculture, and was based on the solar cycle. The 18 Maya months are known, in order, as: Pop, Uo, Zip, Zotz, Tzec, Xuc, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin, Maun, Pax, Kayab and Cumku.

The unlucky five-day period was known as Uayeb, and was considered a time which could hold danger, death and bad luck.

The Vague Year began with the month of Pop. The Maya 20-day month always begins with the seating of the month, followed by days numbered 1 to 19, then the seating of the following month, and so on. This ties in with the Maya notion that each month influences the next.

The Maya new year would start with 1 Pop, followed by 2 Pop, all the way through to 19 Pop, followed by the seating of the month of Uo, written as 0 Uo, then 1 Uo, 2 Uo and so on.

These two cycles coincided every 52 years. The 52-year period of time was called a “bundle” and was similar to a modern-day century.


## Modern Calendars

### Ethiopian Calendar

- [https://www.theworldcalendar.org/ethiopian-calendar/](https://www.theworldcalendar.org/ethiopian-calendar/)

###### This section needs work.

The Ethiopian Calendar is somewhat unique, compared to the rest of the world. They practice that the Annunciation occurred about 8 years after the rest of
the Christian world does, which puts the number year about 8 years behind the calculated number year of the west. So then, 2022, after September, 
would in fact be 2015, while prior to September would be 2014. The reason for this is also interesting... the New Year is on Aug 29 or 30, depending on Leap Year 

The Ethiopian Calendar is a 13 month calendar, with 30 days per month and the 13th month with 5 or 6 days depending on Leap Year. This 13th month seems to be their
New Year celebration, and it coincides with the traditional time of Harvest. This makes a lot of sense for an agriculturally based society.

The Ethiopian Time schedule is unique, and I won't pretend to understand what was meant by [The World Calendar](https://www.theworldcalendar.org/ethiopian-calendar/)
in their article. Suffice to say, however, that they consider the beginning of the new day to start at Sunrise, rather than to turn over in the middle of the night.
