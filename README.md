 What an appropriate name for a nice new calendaring system based on 28-day Lunar Months

We've been working on a calendar of holidays for a long time, when it occured to us that our months are intrinsically stupid. Like, why are there 4 months with 30 days, 7 months of 31 days, and then February (which no-one can spell appropriately) with it's 28 or 29 days? What absurdity is this?

And then we found out about [Eastman (of Kodak)'s 13 month/28 day calendar](/#1). It's brilliant!
